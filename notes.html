        <h2>Keto</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strict Low Carb Intake:</strong> This is paramount. Consistently keeping net carbohydrates very low (aiming for 20-30g/day or less) is the primary driver for successful results on a ketogenic diet.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Healthy Fats:</strong> Focus on monounsaturated fats (olive oil, avocado oil, avocados, macadamia nuts) and Omega-3 fatty acids (fatty fish like salmon/sardines, chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds). Use saturated fats (butter, coconut oil, fatty meats) as well, but ensure a good balance. Avoid artificial trans fats completely.</li>
            <li><strong>Eliminate Sugars & Refined Carbs:</strong> Remove all forms of sugar (table sugar, high fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup), grains (wheat, rice, oats, corn), bread, pasta, sugary drinks, most fruits (berries in small amounts okay), starchy vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes).</li>
            <li><strong>Adequate Fiber:</strong> Include plenty of non-starchy vegetables like leafy greens (spinach, kale, lettuce), broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, green beans, zucchini, bell peppers. Fiber aids digestion and satiety.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit Alcohol Severely:</strong> As detailed in the Drinks Guide, alcohol can significantly raise triglycerides and hinder fat burning. Avoid it if possible, or limit strictly to dry wines/spirits with non-sugary mixers infrequently.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider Exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity (both cardio and resistance training) is highly beneficial for improving insulin sensitivity and lowering triglyceride levels, complementing dietary changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>General Keto Guidance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydration is Key:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for half your body weight in ounces as a starting point (e.g., 150 lbs = 75 oz water), adjusting for activity and climate.</li>
            <li><strong>Electrolyte Management ('Keto Flu' Prevention):</strong> Losing water weight initially also flushes electrolytes. Replenishing is vital:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sodium:</strong> ~5000 mg/day (Don't fear salt! Add sea salt/pink salt to food, drink broth/bouillon, consume pickles/olives).</li>
                    <li><strong>Potassium:</strong> ~3000-4000 mg/day (Found in avocados, spinach, mushrooms, salmon, nuts, meat. Lite Salt can supplement).</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> ~400-500 mg/day (Often needs supplementation. Choose glycinate, citrate, or malate forms - take before bed).</li>
                </ul>
                <em>Note: These are general guidelines; individual needs may vary. Consult resources like the r/keto FAQ for more details.</em>
            </li>
             <li><strong>MCT Oil:</strong> Medium-Chain Triglycerides can provide quick ketone energy. Start with small doses (1 tsp) added to coffee or dressings to assess digestive tolerance. Not essential but can be helpful.</li>
            <li><strong>Intermittent Fasting (IF):</strong> This plan accommodates IF (e.g., 16/8 method - 16 hours fasting, 8-hour eating window like 12 PM-8 PM) by focusing on lunch and dinner. Listen to your body; ensure adequate nutrition within your eating window. IF can further enhance insulin sensitivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Read Labels Carefully:</strong> Be vigilant about hidden sugars and carbs in sauces, dressings, processed meats, and packaged foods. Look at 'Total Carbohydrates' and 'Fiber' to calculate 'Net Carbs' (Total Carbs - Fiber = Net Carbs).</li>
         </ul>

        <h2>Using This Plan</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Leftovers Strategy:</strong> Dinner recipes are generally portioned to allow for leftovers for the next day's lunch, simplifying meal prep during the work week.</li>
             <li><strong>Flexibility Encouraged:</strong> Feel free to swap meals between days or weeks based on preference or ingredient availability. Adjust seasonings and spices to your liking.</li>
             <li><strong>Family/Household Adaptation:</strong> Many main dishes can be shared with non-keto eaters by simply adding a carbohydrate side dish (rice, potatoes, pasta, bread) for them.</li>
             <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Adjust portion sizes based on your hunger, satiety, and energy levels. Focus on adequate protein and healthy fats.</li>
         </ul>
